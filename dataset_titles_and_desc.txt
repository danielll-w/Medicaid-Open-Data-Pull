88: Program Information for Medicaid and CHIP Beneficiaries by Month
This data set includes monthly enrollment counts of Medicaid and CHIP
beneficiaries by program type (Medicaid or CHIP).     These metrics are based on
data in the T-MSIS Analytic Files (TAF). Some states have serious data quality
issues for one or more months, making the data unusable for calculating these
measures. To assess data quality, analysts adapted measures featured in the DQ
Atlas. Data for a state and month are considered unusable or of high concern
based on DQ Atlas thresholds for the topics Medicaid-only Enrollment and M-CHIP
and S-CHIP Enrollment. Please refer to the DQ Atlas at http://medicaid.gov/dq-
atlas for more information about data quality assessment methods.     Some cells
have a value of “DS”. This indicates that data were suppressed for
confidentiality reasons because the group included fewer than 11 beneficiaries.

89: Program Information for Medicaid and CHIP Beneficiaries by Year
This data set presents annual enrollment counts of Medicaid and CHIP

presented: (1) the number of beneficiaries ever enrolled in each program type
over the year (duplicated count); (2) the number of beneficiaries enrolled in
each program type as of an individual’s last month of enrollment (unduplicated

116: Number of pregnant and postpartum Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries, 2017-2020
This table presents the number of pregnant and postpartum Medicaid and CHIP
beneficiaries, 2017-2020. It includes (1) the number and percentage of
beneficiaries ever pregnant in the year; (2) the number and percentage of live
births in the year; (3) the number and percentage of miscarriages, stillbirths,
or terminations in the year; and (4) the number and percentage of births with an
unknown delivery outcome in the year.    These metrics are based on data in the
T-MSIS Analytic Files (TAF). Some states have serious data quality issues,
making the data unusable for identifying this population. Data for a state are
considered unusable based on DQ Atlas thresholds for the following topics: Total
Medicaid and CHIP Enrollment, Claims Volume - IP, Claims Volume - OT, Claims

171: Managed Care Enrollment by Program and Population (Duals)
The Medicaid Managed Care Enrollment Report profiles enrollment statistics on
Medicaid managed care programs on a plan-specific level. The managed care
enrollment statistics include enrollees receiving comprehensive benefits and
limited benefits and are point-in-time counts.    1. Because Medicaid
beneficiaries may be enrolled concurrently in more than one type of managed care
program (e.g., a Comprehensive MCO and a BHO), users should not sum enrollment
across all program types, since the total would count individuals more than once
and, in some states, exceed the actual number of Medicaid enrollees.
2. Comprehensive MCOs cover acute, primary, and specialty medical care services;
they may also cover behavioral health, long-term services and supports, and
other benefits in some states. Limited benefit managed care programs, including
MLTSS only, BHO, Dental, Transportation, and Other cover a narrower set of
services.                                                                 3. The
indicated territory was not able to supply data for this report. The Northern
Mariana Islands reported that they have no Medicaid managed care enrollment, but
they did not report total Medicaid enrollees.
"--" indicates states that do not operates programs of a given type. 0 signifies
that a state operated a program of this type in 2014, but it ended before July
1, 2014, or began after that date.

172: Share of Medicaid Enrollees in Managed Care
The Share of Medicaid Enrollees in any Managed Care and in Comprehensive Managed
CaAre profiles state-level enrollment statistics (numbers and percentages) of
total Medicaid enrollees in any type of managed care as well as those enrolled
specifically in comprehensive managed care programs. The report provides managed
care enrollment by state with all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the US
territories are represented in these data.

173: Managed Care Enrollment Summary
The Medicaid Managed Care Enrollment Report profiles enrollment statistics on
Medicaid managed care programs on a plan-specific level. The managed care
enrollment statistics include enrollees receiving comprehensive benefits and
limited benefits and are point-in-time counts.    1. Total Medicaid Enrollees
represents an unduplicated count of all beneficiaries in FFS and any type of
managed care, including Medicaid-only and Medicare-Medicaid ("dual") enrollees.
2. Total Medicaid enrollment in Any Type of Managed Care represents an
unduplicated count of beneficiaries enrolled in any Medicaid managed care
program, including comprehensive MCOs, limited benefit MCOs, and PCCMs.
3. Medicaid Enrollment in Comprehensive Managed Care represents an unduplicated
count of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in a managed care plan that provides
comprehensive benefits (acute, primary care, specialty, and any other), as well
as PACE programs. It excludes beneficiaries who are enrolled in a Financial
Alignment Initiative Medicare-Medicaid Plan as their only form of managed care.
4. Medicaid Newly Eligible Adults Enrolled in Comprehensive MCOs represents
individuals who are enrolled in comprehensive MCOs and are low-income adults,
with or without dependent children, newly eligible for Medicaid under ACA
Section VIII, and not covered under a waiver or other authority prior to 2014.

174: Managed Care Enrollment by Program and Plan
The Medicaid Managed Care Enrollment Report profiles enrollment statistics on
Medicaid managed care programs on a plan-specific level. The managed care
enrollment statistics include enrollees receiving comprehensive benefits and
limited benefits and are point-in-time counts.    1. The information in this
table was provided by state officials. In some cases, program or plan names in
this table differ from those used in publicly available sources. Questions
regarding state-specific information in this table should be directed to
State/territorial Medicaid officials.

178: Managed Care Enrollment by Program and Population (All)
The Medicaid Managed Care Enrollment Report profiles enrollment statistics on
Medicaid managed care programs on a plan-specific level. The managed care
enrollment statistics include enrollees receiving comprehensive benefits and
limited benefits and are point-in-time counts.    1. Because Medicaid
beneficiaries may be enrolled concurrently in more than one type of managed care
program (e.g., a Comprehensive MCO and a BHO), users should not sum enrollment
across all program types, since the total would count individuals more than once
and, in some states, exceed the actual number of Medicaid enrollees.    2.
Comprehensive MCOs cover acute, primary, and specialty medical care services;
they may also cover behavioral health, long-term services and supports, and
other benefits in some states. Limited benefit managed care programs, including
PCCM, MLTSS only, BHO, Dental, Transportation, and Other cover a narrower set of
services.     "--" indicates states that do not operates programs of a given
type. 0 signifies that a state operated a program of this type in 2014, but it
ended before July 1, 2014, or began after that date.

179: Managed Long Term Services and Supports (MLTSS) Enrollees
1. Enrollment includes both Medicaid-only and Medicare-Medicaid (“dual”)
enrollees. For both types of enrollees, Medicaid covers LTSS. For dual
enrollees, Medicaid may also cover Medicare cost-sharing for acute, primary
care, and specialty services covered by Medicare, and other non-LTSS services
that are not covered by Medicare.                                       2. Some
comprehensive managed care programs enroll beneficiaries who may be at risk of
needing LTSS but do not receive any LTSS. These counts only include individuals
that receive LTSS. Moreover, states differ in their ability to report
individuals who use MLTSS versus those who are enrolled (and may or may not be
using LTSS). This table reports MLTSS users unless otherwise noted.
3. Comprehensive Managed Care Including LTSS does not include PACE programs.
4. MLTSS Only programs cover LTSS under capitation; acute, primary, and
specialty care services for these enrollees may be covered by another Medicaid
MCO, Medicaid FFS, or by Medicare for dual enrollees. These data include states
that provide MLTSS plus other benefits in a package that does not include
inpatient medical care.                                          5. The
indicated territory was not able to supply data for this report. The Northern
Mariana Islands reported that they have no Medicaid managed care enrollment, but
they did not report total Medicaid enrollees.  6. Enrollment and user counts
include both Medicaid-only enrollees and dually eligible individuals. For both
types of enrollees, Medicaid covers LTSS. For dually eligible individuals,
Medicaid may also cover Medicare cost-sharing for acute, primary care, and
specialty services covered by Medicare, and other non-LTSS services that are not
covered by Medicare.

180: Product Data for Newly Reported Drugs in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program 2023-07-17-to-2023-07-23
The data below contains newly reported, active covered outpatient drugs which

184: Presumptive Eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP Coverage
Health care providers and Head Start programs can play a major role in finding
and enrolling uninsured children through presumptive eligibility. States can
authorize “qualified entities” -- health care providers, community-based
organizations, and schools, among others -- to screen for Medicaid and CHIP
eligibility and immediately enroll children who appear to be eligible.
Presumptive eligibility allows children to get access to Medicaid or CHIP
services without having to wait for their application to be fully processed.
Qualified entities can also help families gather the documents needed to
complete the full application process, thereby reducing the administrative
burden on States to obtain missing information.

185: Managed Care Programs by State
Provides program names, program features, population enrolled, benefits covered,
quality assurance and improvement, performance incentives, provider value-based
purchasing, participating plans, regions served and program notes.

186: Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Payments - Annual Reporting Requirements
Federal law requires that state Medicaid programs make Disproportionate Share
Hospital (DSH) payments to qualifying hospitals that serve a large number of
Medicaid and uninsured individuals. State-specific annual DSH reports are posted
as submitted by states based on their availability.    For more information,
visit https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/finance/dsh/index.html.

187: Express Lane Eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP Coverage
States may rely on eligibility information from "Express Lane" agency programs
to streamline and simplify enrollment and renewal in Medicaid and CHIP. Express
Lane agencies may include Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),
School Lunch programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Head Start, and
the Women, infant, and children's program (WIC) , among others. States can also
use state income tax data to determine Medicaid and CHIP eligibility for
children.

188: Continuous Eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP Coverage
States have the option to provide children with 12 months of continuous coverage
through Medicaid and CHIP, even if the family experiences a change in income
during the year. Continuous eligibility is a valuable tool that helps States
ensure that children stay enrolled in the health coverage for which they are
eligible and have consistent access to needed health care services.

192: NAM CAHPS 2014 Public Use
In fall 2014, the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) conducted a
Nationwide Adult Medicaid (NAM) Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and
Systems (CAHPS) survey of Medicaid enrollees to attain national and state-by-
state measures of access, barriers to care, and experiences with care across
delivery systems and major population subgroups. The survey interviewed a
representative sample of adults ages 18 and older enrolled in Medicaid during
October through December 2013.  Additional information, including a data
dictionary and analysis guidance and downloadable SAS files are available on the
<a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/quality-of-care/performance-
measurement/adult-cahps/index.html">NAM CAHPS</a> webpage. Please note that all
analyses must account for the survey’s sample design and use weights and strata.

data represent the principal, but not all, MAGI coverage groups in Medicaid, the
Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Basic Health Program (BHP).
All income standards are expressed as a percentage of the federal poverty level
(FPL). The MAGI-based rules generally include adjusting an individual’s income
by an amount equivalent to a 5% FPL disregard. Other eligibility criteria also
apply, such as citizenship, immigration status, and state residency.    For more

affected by mitigation strategies in place, such as those related to ex parte
functionality. States report renewal outcomes for a cohort in the month renewals
are scheduled for completion. Hawaii and Vermont experienced a natural disaster,
and the number of renewals initiated and completed in the reporting period were
impacted due to the disaster response efforts in the month of August. South
Carolina does not have renewal outcomes to report in the month of July.
Massachusetts reports the dispositions of renewals completed in the reporting
period. Therefore, the state is unable to report the number of pending renewals
to CMS, and Massachusetts’ data are excluded from the national totals for the
May - July 2023 reporting periods. Vermont experienced a natural disaster, and
the number of renewals initiated and completed in the July reporting period were
impacted due to the disaster response efforts. Texas does not have renewal
outcomes to report in the month of June. For the May 2023 reporting period,
Texas’ renewal disposition data include actions completed after the end of the
reporting period. For the April 2023 reporting period, Iowa's renewal
disposition data include actions completed after the end of the reporting
period. States that held procedural terminations reflect these data in metric 5d
as pending renewals along with renewals that were due but not completed by the
end of the reporting period. See the Data Sources and Metrics Definitions

a full description of the differences between the SBM operating systems and
resulting data metrics, measure definitions, and general data limitations. As of
the September 2023 report, this table was updated to differentiate between SBMs
with an integrated Medicaid, CHIP, and Marketplace eligibility system and those
with an account transfer process to better represent the percentage of QHP
selections in relation to applicable consumers received and processed by the
relevant SBM. State-specific variations are:     - Maine’s data and Nevada’s
April and May data report all applications with Medicaid/CHIP denials or
terminations, not only those part of the annual renewal process.   -
Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Washington also report applications with
consumers determined ineligible for Medicaid/CHIP due to procedural reasons.  -
Minnesota and New York report on eligibility and enrollment for their Basic
Health Programs.  - Idaho’s April data on consumers eligible for a QHP with
financial assistance does not depict a direct correlation to consumers with a
QHP selection.  - Only SBMs with an automatic plan assignment process have and
report automatic QHP selections. These SBMs make automatic plan assignments into
a QHP for a subset of individuals and provide a notification of options
regarding active selection of an alternative plan and/or, if applicable, making
the first month’s premium payment.  </li>    <li>SBMs report on all applicable
applications received and not on the Medicaid-defined cohorts of individuals
whose renewal is due in a given month. The data in this table is not cumulative
and counts unique Marketplace activities during the reporting period month in
which the relevant activity occurs. As such, activities by any one consumer may
be included across reporting months. For example, a consumer who submits an
application and receives a determination of QHP eligibility may be counted in
one month but his/her plan selection could be counted in a later month. Thus,
the percentages do not necessarily depict a direct correlation to the count of
consumers on applications received during the current reporting month. Total
counts represent activity across the reporting months and is not cumulative as
of the latest reporting month. Updated applications in the reporting month are
only counted once. Updated applications in a following month may be counted
again in that applicable month only if the consumer obtains a new Medicaid/CHIP
renewal.</li>    <li> SBMs have different operational processes and eligibility
systems for handling QHP, Medicaid and CHIP eligibility determinations. While
CMS works with SBMs to align the metric definitions across the Marketplaces
there can be limitations and anomalies among the SBM data due to different SBM
system capabilities. Additionally, variances in the data may be attributable to
differences in how states are conducting unwinding renewals including processing
timelines and whether states are staging applications for population cohorts
(e.g., over age 65).  a Percent of consumers on applications whose Medicaid/CHIP
coverage was denied or terminated following renewal during the reporting period
month.         b Percent of consumers on account transfers whose Medicaid/CHIP
coverage was denied or terminated following renewal during the reporting period
month. The percentages for SBMs with integrated eligibility systems and the SBM
Total - Integrated and SBM Total data record groups are marked as not available
(NA) because SBMs with integrated eligibility systems do not receive account
transfers. Additionally, the percentages for some SBMs with account transfer
processes and the SBM Total - Account Transfer data record group are marked as
not available (NA) because not all consumers on applications who are connected
to an account transfer are counted in 'Consumers on Account Transfers Associated
with a Medicaid/CHIP Coverage Denial or Termination Following Renewal.' For
example, Pennsylvania conducts automatic eligibility determinations for
Marketplace plans for some account transfers and counts those consumers only in
the application metrics. </li>  </ol>     <p>APTC: Advance Premium Tax Credit;
